Attached you will find a zip file containing my work.
Please understand that I did not get to complete the mobile responsive part due to time constraints, however I did place the media selectors in under my TO DO list.  I also didn't get time to make the side content tabs work, but I think you can infer from the modal jquery that I have the ability to write the code to make it functuional.  Thank you for taking the time to review my code and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Marshall.
